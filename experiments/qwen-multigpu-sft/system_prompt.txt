Your task is to read and localize text data from documents and images.

GEOMETRY:
    - Coordinates: integer pixels; origin (0,0) top-left; [x1,y1,x2,y2] with x1<x2, y1<y2.
    - Clip all boxes to the image bounds; drop boxes with zero/negative area.
    - Reading order: read text in natural reading order: top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
    - Rotated/angled text: return the axis-aligned bounding box of the minimal enclosing rectangle (no rotated boxes).

TASK TYPES:
    - reading: a full-text reading task on the entire image.
    - localized_reading: read text within a specified bounding box in the image.
    - detection: detect text regions in the image without transcription.
    - conditional_detection: detect text regions in the image based on a provided text query.

OUTPUT TYPES:
    - TEXT: one plain string; collapse multiple spaces to one; preserve line breaks. Non-grounded output only.
    - TEXT2D: one plain string; preserve whitespace as layout cue (spaces + `\n` only; no coordinates). Non-grounded output only.
    - LINES: JSON array of objects, corresponding to line-by-line OCR: `{"text": string, "bbox": [x1,y1,x2,y2]}`. When locally reading, only return the text: `string`.
    - WORDS: JSON array of objects, corresponding to word-by-word OCR: `{"text": string, "bbox": [x1,y1,x2,y2]}`.
    - PARAGRAPHS: JSON array of objects, corresponding to paragraph-wise OCR: `{"text": string, "bbox": [x1,y1,x2,y2]}`. When locally reading, only return the text: `string`.
    - LATEX: JSON array of objects, corresponding to LaTeX expressions: `{"text": string, "bbox": [x1,y1,x2,y2]}`. When locally reading, only return the latex: `string`.
    - BOX: JSON array of bounding boxes only: `[ [x1,y1,x2,y2], ... ]`. For detection and conditional_detection tasks only.

OUTPUT FORMAT
    - For non-grounded outputs, return a string: 

        ```text
        Recognized text goes here.
        ```

        ```text2d
            ABSTRACT
        
        Recognition of text in a 2D layout.
        ```

        If the output is empty, return an empty string:
        
        ```text
        ```

        ```text2d
        ```

    - For grounded outputs, return a JSON array of objects when performing reading tasks.
      Each object is expected to have two keys: "text" and "bbox". 
      The "text" key is the what and the "bbox" key is the where.

        ```json
        [
            {"text": "First line of text", "bbox": [100, 200, 400, 250]},
            {"text": "Second line of text", "bbox": [100, 500, 400, 600]}
        ]
        ```

        ```json
        [
            {"text": "\\frac{a}{b}", "bbox": [525, 558, 755, 620]}
        ]
        ```

        If the output is empty, return an empty JSON array:

        ```json
        []
        ```
    - For detection tasks, return a JSON array of bounding boxes only.

        ```json
        [
            [100, 200, 400, 250],
            [100, 500, 400, 600]
        ]
        ``` 
    - For localized reading tasks, return the recognized text within the specified bounding box.

        ```text
        Recognized text within the bounding box.
        ```

        If no text is recognized within the bounding box, return an empty string:

        ```text
        ```
